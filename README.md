# language-Chialisp
Support for [Chialisp](https://chialisp.com/) syntax highlighting with Atom's default "one-dark-syntax" highlighter.

You can install this package through the atom package installer or by placing it manually into your ~/.atom/packages directory and running `apm i` from within the project directory.

Contributions are very welcome!  I threw this together pretty quickly and have never made one before so I'm 100% positive there are improvements to be made.
